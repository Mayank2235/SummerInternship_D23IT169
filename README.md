Day 22 :- Bolstered the security of a WordPress website with a two-pronged approach:
          1)Wordfence Security: This powerful firewall acts as a shield, deflecting malicious traffic and malware attempts.
          2) iThemes Security: This plugin fortifies user credentials, making them tougher to crack through brute force attacks.

Day 23:-Leveled up a WordPress site's security today with iThemes Security!
        1)Enabled two-factor authentication: This adds an extra layer of defense, requiring users to confirm their login with a code beyond just their password.
        2)Fortified against brute force attacks: Put a stop to automated attempts to crack logins by setting limitations on login tries.

Day 24:- Fixed a glitch in iThemes Security's two-factor authentication! Now, user logins are secured with an extra layer of defense, keeping unauthorized access at bay.

Day 25:-Defeated malware threats on a WordPress site today!
        1)Patched the iThemes Security scanner: Fixed problems with the plugin's malware detection, ensuring it can accurately spot and eliminate hidden threats.
        2)Doubled down on security: This not only protects the site from harm but also improves its performance by removing malicious code that could slow things down.

Day 26:-Today, we encountered issues with the iThemes Security plugin causing unexpected site slowdowns. We spent the day troubleshooting the conflict, aiming to restore optimal performance without compromising the site's security features.

Day 27-Weekend

Day 28:- Weekend

Day 29:- Wordfence firewall got a tune-up today! I identified overly restrictive settings that were blocking valid traffic. By adjusting the configurations, I restored proper access while keeping the site securely protected.

Day 30: Leveled up website security with a deep dive into WP Cerber!  (6 hours well spent!)
        1)Activated advanced spam filters: No more comment sections overflowing with junk! This ensures only legitimate messages get through.
        2)Established custom IP blocking rules: Unwanted visitors are out! These rules block suspicious or malicious IP addresses from accessing the site.
        3)Fine-tuned the traffic inspector: Like a digital detective, I configured the inspector to closely monitor site activity, helping identify potential threats.

Day 31: Refining WP Cerber's security net!
        1)Tweaked spam filters: Yesterday's settings got even better, ensuring only the good stuff gets through to your comments section.
        2)Sharpened IP blocking rules: Suspicious activity flagged by the traffic inspector? No problem! I refined the rules to keep those unwanted visitors out.
        3)Investigated and addressed security alerts: The traffic inspector did its job, and I followed up by resolving any potential issues it identified.


Day 32:-  WP Cerber security configured and ready to roll!
        1)Double-checked everything: This morning, I gave the security settings a final once-over to ensure everything's running smoothly.
        2)Spam and intruders at bay: With robust spam protection and effective IP blocking rules in place, your site is well-shielded from unwanted visitors and comment sections                    overflowing with junk.
        3) Project complete! We wrapped things up by midday, leaving your site secure and protected.
